# alpaca-trading
Building a project set up for algo trading using AWS Cloud EKS

### What is this project about ? ###
I am looking to build an automated trading bot where I will be creating all strategies which are having 90% and above success rate. 
Along with that, I want to build logics to place buy and sell orders, based on condition met.
Currently, the bot solution will be build using paper trading alpaca trading api.
Downstream, I will incorporate this trading bot for multiple brokers for Stocks & Cryptos trading.

Technologies will be used for the project -
Front end building app - React Native
All logics and code will be written - Python
Database - Redis
Hosting on AWS EKS

I will be keep on updating the document, based on my thoughts and requirement as and when I feel there is a better solution.
